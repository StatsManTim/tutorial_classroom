About
=====

This is the tutorial classroom package developed in http://github.com/pelson/lessons_for_a_scientific_programmer. 

The "classroom" package is a simple interface to a collection of YAML files containing the names of groups within the tutorial.
These groups will have been submitted by the attendees of the tutorial.



Technical detail
================

There are two branches:

 * master - the template of a "classroom" package
 * full_package - the filled in template of the "classroom" package

Any content in both master and full_package should be modified against master and merged back to full_package later.
